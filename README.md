Personal Portfolio Website             (Sep-2022) 
I built a personal portfolio website to showcase my work and skills. The website is built on a custom and I 
used a variety of google sheet to add features such as a portfolio, contact form and to download my cv in 
my portfolio and show my skills and experience. 
**Technologies Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BootStrap
